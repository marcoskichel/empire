  Turn a concept, codebase, flow, or comparison into a diagram instead of a wall of
  text — terminal-native ASCII (architecture, flowcharts, state machines, sequences,
  trees, comparison tables); mermaid only when output targets GitHub or a markdown
  viewer. Use when the user wants something drawn, mapped, or visualized rather than
  described in prose. Trigger phrases: "draw this", "diagram this", "visualize", "show
  me a diagram", "map this out", "flowchart", "architecture diagram", "sequence
  diagram", "state machine", "ascii diagram", "make this visual",
  "/empire-visual:visualize".
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob

<section id="core">

**A diagram loads two cognitive channels; prose loads one.** Verbal and visual
information travel separate paths (dual-coding theory), and working memory saturates
fast (cognitive load theory). A labeled diagram lets a reader grasp structure at a
glance and hold it longer. This skill converts a thing-with-structure into the visual
that carries it best.

Scope: structure, flow, state, sequence, hierarchy, comparison, quantity. If the
answer has no structure — a single fact, a yes/no — do NOT force a diagram. Say it.

</section>

<section id="process">

1. **Identify what has structure.** Read the source if needed (`Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` a
   file, function, or directory). Find the entities and the relationships between them —
   that is what the diagram encodes.
2. **Match intent to format** (table below). One intent → one primary format. Do not mix
   three diagram types in one figure.
3. **Choose the render target.** Terminal/chat → ASCII. GitHub/PR/markdown viewer →
   mermaid is allowed. When unsure → ASCII (it renders everywhere).
4. **Draw it, then prune.** Apply the quality bar. Cut every element that carries no
   meaning.
5. **Add only the prose the picture cannot encode** — the _why_, a caveat, the next step.

| State / lifecycle transitions         | ASCII state diagram                |
| Request path / call order             | Numbered sequence or `A → B → C`   |
| Options / trade-offs / feature matrix | Markdown table                     |
| Quantities / distribution / progress  | ASCII bars (`█████░░░`) or a table |

<section id="render-rules">

- MUST default to ASCII / Unicode box-drawing + Markdown tables. They render in the
  Claude Code terminal TUI, IDE panels, and GitHub.
- MUST use a ` ```mermaid ` block ONLY when output targets GitHub, a PR, or a markdown
  viewer. The terminal TUI does NOT render mermaid — it prints the raw source. Never
  make mermaid the sole representation in a terminal reply. When both terminal and
  GitHub are in play, lead with ASCII; offer mermaid as an addition if asked.
- SHOULD keep box-drawing characters consistent within one figure: `┌ ┐ └ ┘ ├ ┤ ┬ ┴ ┼ │ ─`
  for boxes, `→ ← ↑ ↓` for flow.

<section id="quality-bar">

Badly built diagrams read as visual noise — worse than prose. Enforce:

- **Coherence** — exclude every element that does not carry meaning. Fewer nodes wins.
- **Spatial contiguity** — labels inside or directly beside what they label, never in a
  separate paragraph.
- **Size** — under ~15 nodes per figure. Bigger → split into layers or show the top
  level and drill down on request.
- **No redundancy** — do not restate in prose what the figure already shows.

quantity bars — read `references/diagram-templates.md`.
